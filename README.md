# TO-DO List react 
## Project Description
This project is all about to-do list. Sometimes we just forget what we do, so in that case we used this to-do list to remind our daily routine work. In this to-do list we have to make a todo and after conformation the task we have to delete it.

## How to use
clone the repo and CD into it.

## In this project we have to do like it:-
### to make the react app
```html
npx create-react-app app-name
```
### After this we have to change the directory to the app name
```html
cd app-name
```

### And later on we have to start the server
```html
npm start
```

## Working of the project:-
So, in this project we have to make a react app name called "mukul-app" in my case. And after this we have to make the Components folder into the "src" folder and make sure we do not touch the "public" folder. And we have make the react files into the Components folder and all the files must me export and import into the App.js in the "src" folder and after this we use some routing just to go to one page to another page.

We have the front end part, in which it have the ability to store the data into the frontend screen and it has two section one is Todo title and other one is Todo Description. And if we fill both the blank and hit "Add Todo" button so, it will be visible to our screen and there is a delete button option as well. So, if in case if we did our task so we used to delete it.
